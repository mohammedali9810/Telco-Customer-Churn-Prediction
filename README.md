# Telco-Customer Churn Prediction
Identify and try predict the probability of customers churning in various cases

## context
Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics  because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.
